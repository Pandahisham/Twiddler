Twiddler
========

This currently is a catch all package that uses other node text manipulation packages as well as my own little experiments that help me process and twiddle text.

### Ideas

- Make into a more robust CLI app that stores various configurations from processing jobs
- Build a GUI app using Electron that makes configuring and using the modules in here easy to use- think Open Refine, but more user friend and robust
